                    <li>Oil: A neutral oil, such as vegetable oil, adds moisture without imparting flavor.</li>
                    <li>Eggs: Four whole eggs lend moisture and help bind the carrot cake batter together.</li>
                    <li>Vanilla: Two teaspoons of vanilla extract for the cake (and one teaspoon for the frosting) enhances the flavor.</li>
                    <li>Flour: All-purpose flour creates structure and brings the batter together.</li>
                    <li> Leaveners: Baking soda and baking powder act as leaveners, which means they help the cake rise.</li>
                    <li>Cinnamon: Ground cinnamon adds that warm, cozy flavor you associate with carrot cake.</li>
                    <li>Salt: Salt enhances the flavors of the other ingredients, but it won't make the cake taste salty.</li>
