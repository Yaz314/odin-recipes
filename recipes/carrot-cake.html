            <h3 class="title">Ingredients</h3>
                <ol class="list">
                    <li>Sugars: You'll need white sugar for the cake and confectioners' sugar for the frosting.</li>
                    <li>Oil: A neutral oil, such as vegetable oil, adds moisture without imparting flavor.</li>
                    <li>Eggs: Four whole eggs lend moisture and help bind the carrot cake batter together.</li>
                    <li>Vanilla: Two teaspoons of vanilla extract for the cake (and one teaspoon for the frosting) enhances the flavor.</li>
                    <li>Flour: All-purpose flour creates structure and brings the batter together.</li>
                    <li> Leaveners: Baking soda and baking powder act as leaveners, which means they help the cake rise.</li>
                    <li>Cinnamon: Ground cinnamon adds that warm, cozy flavor you associate with carrot cake.</li>
                    <li>Salt: Salt enhances the flavors of the other ingredients, but it won't make the cake taste salty.</li>
                    <li>Carrots: Of course, you'll need grated carrots!</li>
                    <li>Pecans: Chopped pecans give the cake and frosting a pleasant crunch.</li>
                    <li>Butter and cream cheese: Butter and cream cheese are the key ingredients in the light and fluffy cream cheese frosting.</li>
                </ol>

                    <h3 class="title">Steps</h3>
